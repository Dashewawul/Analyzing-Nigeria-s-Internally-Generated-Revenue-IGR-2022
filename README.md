# Nigeria Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) Analysis 2022 🇳🇬💰

## Project Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) for all Nigerian states in 2022. The project explores the diverse revenue streams—ranging from Direct Assessments and Road Taxes to LGA-level collections—to provide a clear picture of state-level fiscal independence.

## 📊 Features
- **State-by-State Comparison:** Ranking of all 36 states and the FCT based on total IGR.
- **Revenue Stream Breakdown:** Analysis of PAYE, Stamp Duties, Capital Gains Tax, and Withholding Tax.
- **LGA Insights:** Exploration of revenue generated at the Local Government level.
- **Pivot Reporting:** Summary tables showing the distribution of MDAs (Ministries, Departments, and Agencies) revenue vs. Tax revenue.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `IGR DATA 2019-2022 (Recovered).csv`: The primary dataset containing state-level tax breakdowns.
- `IGR DATA 2019-2022 (Recovered) - pivot table.csv`: Summarized views and rankings of revenue categories.
